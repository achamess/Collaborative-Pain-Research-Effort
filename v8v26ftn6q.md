## Technologies

### Descriptive Readouts (What is there?) -> Measurements 

#### Single Cell and Cell-Specific Methods (Genomics/Proteomics)

- Single Cell RNA-seq/Single Nucleus RNA-seq
- Single Cell ATAC-seq

- Fiber photometry 


##### Voltage Imaging










### Activity-mapping

#### Question 2: What regions of the neuraxis participate in different aspects of pain and itch (cellular resolution)

##### Labeling

**Global** 

Immediate early gene (IEG)-based activity-mapping with different nociceptive and pruriceptive stimuli    

- FosTRAP mouse
- FosGFP mouse

**Targeted**  

- FLARE or CAL-LIGHT
- CANE (Fan Wang)
- CaMPARI

##### Visualization

- Optical clearing + Light Sheet Microscopy
    - CLARITY 
    - CUBIC
    - iDisco

- Serial Two Photon Tomography (STP)




## Applications 

### Question 1: What are the cell types that reside in pain-related regions of the neuraxis?

- Brain
- Spinal Cord
- DRG
- Non-neural tissues (e.g. skin, gut)
