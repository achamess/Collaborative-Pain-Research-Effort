# Specific Research Goals

## Tools

### Generation of a standard and specific set of recombinase (Cre and Flp) driver lines for targeting pain-related cells
- DRG lines
    - With multiple single-cell studies now having defined canonical classes of DRG neurons (Usoskin et al), we should have a standard set of Cre- and Flp- mice that can definitively 


## Describe

### Cell Types

Question: What are the cell types that reside in pain-related regions of the neuraxis?
	- Brain
	- Spinal Cord
	- DRG
 
 Solutions:
 	- Use single-cell or single-nucleus RNA-seq to generate a census at every region
 	- Highly multiplexed Fluorescent In Situ
