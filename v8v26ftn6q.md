Purpose and Vision:
This review article will broadly summarize some of the powerful emerging technologies in neuroscience with a focus on their application to the study of pain. Whenever possible, examples in which these technologies have already been applied to pain will be given (ex. Optogenetics, Calcium Imaging). In the second part of the review, we will outline fundamental and large-scale questions that may now be profitably studied using these emerging technologies.

### Question : How are the cells in the pain system connected?

### Question : What is the behavioral signature of pain in model organisms and humans?

### Question : What is the contribution of each cell type to the behavioral outputs of pain?

### Question : What are the morphological, electrophysiological, and genomic properties of pain-related cells and how do those features give rise to distinct functional contributions?

### Question : Which cell types and cell ensembles are engaged by different noxious stimuli?

### Question : How do different pathological insults alter the properties of pain-related cell types?

### Question : How do other sensory and motor systems interact with pain-related systems?
