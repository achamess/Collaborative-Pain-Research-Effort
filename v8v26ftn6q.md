## Cell Types

### Question 1: What are the cell types that reside in pain-related regions of the neuraxis?

- Brain
- Spinal Cord
- DRG
- Non-neural tissues (e.g. skin, gut)
 
### Technologies

### Single Cell Genomics

- Use single-cell or single-nucleus RNA-seq to generate a cellular census at every region
    -  Drop-seq/10x
    -  combinatorial indexing
    -  FACS + Smart-seq2


### Spatial Transcriptomics




- Highly multiplexed Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH) or Spatial Transcriptomic method to determine the genes expressed by cells in their native locations
    - MERFISH
 	- seqFISH
 	- DNA-Exchange Imaging
 	- FISSEQ
 	- 
 


### Activity-mapping

#### Question 2: What regions of the neuraxis participate in different aspects of pain and itch (cellular resolution)

##### Labeling

**Global** 

Immediate early gene (IEG)-based activity-mapping with different nociceptive and pruriceptive stimuli    

- FosTRAP mouse
- FosGFP mouse

**Targeted**  

- FLARE or CAL-LIGHT
- CANE (Fan Wang)
- CaMPARI

##### Visualization

- Optical clearing + Light Sheet Microscopy
    - CLARITY 
    - CUBIC
    - iDisco

- Serial Two Photon Tomography (STP)
